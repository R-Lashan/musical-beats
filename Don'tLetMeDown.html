           <h6>Lyrics</h6>
           <p>Crashing, hit a wall<br>
            Right now I need a miracle<br>
            Hurry up now, I need a miracle<br>
            Stranded, reaching out<br>
            I call your name, but you're not around<br>
            I say your name, but you're not around
            </p><br>

            <p>I need you, I need you, I need you right now<br>
                Yeah, I need you right now<br>
                So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down<br>
                I think I'm losing my mind now</p><br>

            <p>No damsel in distress, don't need to save me<br>
                Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me<br>
                And you might think I'm weak without a sword<br>
                But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours
              </p><br>

            <p>It's in my head, darling, I hope<br>
                That you'll be here when I need you the most, so<br>
                Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down<br>
                D-don't let me down
            </p><br>

            <p>Don't let me down<br>
                Don't let me down, down, down<br>
                Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
            </p><br>

            <P>R-r-running out of time<br>
                I really thought you were on my side<br>
                But now there's nobody by my side
                
            </P><br>

            <p>I need you, I need you, I need you right now<br>
                Yeah, I need you right now<br>
                So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down<br>
                I think I'm losing my mind now
            </p><br>
            
            <p>It's in my head, darling, I hope<br>
                That you'll be here when I need you the most, so<br>
                Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down<br>
                D-don't let me down
            </p><br>

            <p>Don't let me down<br>
                Don't let me down, down, down<br>
                Don't let me down, down, down<br>
                Don't let me down, down, down<br>
                Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down</p><br>
         
             <P>Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah (yeah)<br>
                Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah (yeah)<br>
                I need you, I need you, I need you right now<br>
                Yeah, I need you right now<br>
                So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down<br>
                I think I'm losing my mind now</P><br>

             <P>It's in my head, darling, I hope<br>
                That you'll be here when I need you the most, so<br>
                Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down<br>
                Don't let me down</P><br>

            <P>Yeah, don't let me down<br>
                Yeah, don't let me down<br>
                Don't let me down, oh no<br>
                Said, "Don't let me down"<br>
                Don't let me down, no<br>
                Don't let me down<br>
                Don't let me down, down, down</P><br>
