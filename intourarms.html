           <h6>Lyrics</h6>
           <p>I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I<br>
            If you let me, I'll be<br>
            Out of my dress and into your arms tonight<br>
            Yeah, I'm lost without it<br>
            Feels like I'm always waitin'<br>
            I need you to come get me<br>
            Out of my head, and into your arms tonight, tonight</p><br>

            <p>Yeah, I don't mean to make you wait<br>
              Just the pressure's been gettin' heavy<br>
              I know if I fuck us up, we'll be over, done, you'll forget me<br>
              Forget me, I'm feelin' bad that I act this way, 'cause you let me<br>
              They call me king, but I know my queen will be there to check me<br>
              Last year, was runnin' 'round 45th lookin' for SoHo<br>
              Last night, was ridin' down Rodeo lookin' for no ho<br>
              It's crazy what can change in a year, think that you know though<br>
              Go back and forth like a yo-yo, they live their life for the photos</p><br>

            <p>They see me, I'm actin' solo, 'cause I'm afraid to commit<br>
              Now, can you tell me how I'm different than him, and him, and him?<br>
              Yeah, I know I'm always questionin' things, like, girl<br>
              Would you say that love cannot be found inside a vow or a ring?<br>
              She laughs and says, only material things<br>
              Those are material things, imagine buyin' all my trust with a ring<br>
              Imagine spendin' all my love on a fling, got a thing for you<br>
              If I had the talent you had, I probably would sing for you, like
              
              </p><br>

            <p>I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I<br>
              If you let me, I'll be<br>
              Out of my dress and into your arms tonight<br>
              Yeah, I'm lost without it<br>
              Feels like I'm always waitin'<br>
              I need you to come get me<br>
              Out of my head, and into your arms tonight, tonight
            </p><br>

            <p>Yeah, I don't mean to make you wait or to contemplate about us<br>
              My ex, she loved to lie, guess that's why it's harder to trust<br>
              I been searchin' to find myself and not get too lost into lust<br>
              I heard once that you can try, but can't fill from an empty cup<br>
              That's no lie, and all I ever say is how I need time<br>
              If it was up to you now, you would be mine<br>
              I'm on the road more than I'm home<br>
              And still I find it's only you on my mind<br>
              The last three were gemini, I take that sh-t as a sign, it's funny<br>
              You can't buy time with your money<br>
              And you love goin' to the beach whether it's cloudy or sunny<br>
              And you love drinkin' all your wine until it hurts in your tummy<br>
              You call me, honey, I'm tipsy<br>
              And really all I want is for you to love me
            </p><br>

            <P>Flashbacks to backroads drivin' back to my side of state<br>
              I know I need to tell you, I can't before it's too late<br>
              Before someone steps to the plate, before you decide not to wait<br>
              Before you decide not to chaster, you call me up, just to say<br>
            </P><br>

            <p>I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I<br>
              If you let me, I'll be<br>
              Out of my dress and into your arms tonight (oh, baby)<br>
              Yeah, I'm lost without it<br>
              Feels like I'm always waitin'<br>
              I need you to come get me (ohhh)<br>
              Out of my head, and into your arms tonight<br>
              Tonight (yeah, yeah)
            </p><br>
